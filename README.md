# Simple REST Api app for store creation
Using Flask and REST principles to create an application with various endpoints to implement the functioning of an api and testing the api working using javascript.

## Libraries involved:

#### Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework written in Python designed to make quick easy and scalable applications.

#### jsonify
Creates a Response with the JSON representation of the given arguments with an application/json mimetype.

#### request
It contains all the data that is sent from the client to the server.


#### render_template
Generate output from a template file based on the Jinja2 engine that is found in the application's templates folder.




### To run the application:

` python app.py `

or 


` python3 app.py `

Now you will see link like 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' or something like that, open the link in browser

You will reach the home page with 'hello world' message and the api will be running.

> You should test the working using POSTMAN
